The intuition:
    1.We use for agents to make the revision task:
        1.Task decomposer:
            Given the original text and the original prompts, and let the agent to generate the promblems and issues strictly (no actual revisions will be made during this process.)
            The agent needs to return a simple report pointing several problems that the passage have faced.
        2.Editor Conservative and Editor Creative
            Where actual revisions take place. Set different temperatures for the "imagination"
            !The two editor will not influence each other, works parallelly.
        3.integrator: 
            Integrate for both two passage to make better improvements
            To make better improvements and allow more diversity, we allow the maxlength of current passage is the 1.5*max_length
        4.Reporter
            Check the format and restrict words.( \le maxlength)

    2.For the first version, we will just make one round conversation:
        User -> Task decomposer -> Editor Conservative  -> Integrator -> Reporter
                                -> Editor Creative      ->
    3. To avoid information loss, we will pass total_prompt and the original text for all agents.
